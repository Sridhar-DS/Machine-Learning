# Machine-Learning
Project for Machine learning course
The RMD is submitted as part of the Machine learning course project work.

The RMD code can be downloaded and executed. The R code gets to the URL to download the test and training datasets. 
Hence an internet connection is required. Other than that the machine needs to have caret and randon forest packages installed.
